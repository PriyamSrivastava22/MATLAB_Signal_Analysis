# MATLAB_Signal_Analysis
This MATLAB App Designer-based signal analysis software offers an interactive application for manipulating and analyzing signals. Users can adjust signal amplitude and frequency in real-time, use grid lines for better visualization, and view both graphical and mathematical signal representations. It allows conversion of signals into periodic and discrete forms, enhancing its analytical capabilities. The dual display aids students in understanding the mathematical and visual aspects of signals. Users can save analysis results for future use, making the software a powerful tool for studying signal properties across multiple domains.
